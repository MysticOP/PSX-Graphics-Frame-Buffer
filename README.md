# PSX-Graphics-Frame-Buffer
PSX-Graphics-Frame-Buffer (PSX-GFB) is a PSX Graphics Engine For Your PSX Emulator. Support With Resolutions From 640x480 To 1440p, This Open Source Graphics Engine Is Very Useful For People Who Are New To Emulation. 
PSX GFB Was Programmed In Csharp (C#) Using Visual Studio 2019.
This Project Is Only Mainly For My PSX Emulator But I Thought I Would Upload It On Github.
